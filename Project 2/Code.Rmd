## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loadWine}
wine.cols <- c('fixed_acidity', 'volatile_acidity', 'citric_acid', 'residual_sugar', 'chlorids', 'free_sulfur_dioxide', 'total_sulfur_dioxide', 'density', 'pH', 'sulphates', 'alcohol', 'quality')

wine.white <- read.csv('./data/winequality-white.csv',  sep=";", skip = 1, header=F)
wine.red <- read.csv('./data/winequality-red.csv',  sep=";", skip =1, header=F)
names(wine.white) <- wine.cols
names(wine.red) <- wine.cols

wine.white['type'] <- 1
wine.red['type'] <- 2

wines <- rbind(wine.white, wine.red)
wines$type <- factor(wines$type, labels=c('white', 'red'))

View(wines)
```

```{r}
summary(wine.white)

kmeans(wine.white, 3)
```
```{r}
summary(wine.red)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
